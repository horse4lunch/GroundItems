# Highlight Stackable Items
A plugin that will highlight drops that can be stacked on items already in your inventory.

Example. If you have fire runes in your inventory fire runes will be highlighted.

This plugin is making constant changes to the Highlighted Items list of the built in "Ground items" plugin. Any highlighted items you already had will Automatically be copied over, but if you want to manually add new highlighted items do it through this plugin not "Ground Items". Otherwise your changes will not be saved.
