# Highlight Stackable Items
A plugin that will highlight drops that can be stacked on items already in your inventory.

Example. If you have fire runes in your inventory fire runes will be highlighted.

This plugin uses the Highlighted Items feature of the built in "Ground items" plugin. If you have other items already highlighted in "Ground Items" copy and paste them into the corosponding box in the Highlighted Stackable Items config.
